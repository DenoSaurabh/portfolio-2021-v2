# My 2021/2022 Portfolio

## About me

I started this journey in 2018 when I was just 14 years old, I started
learning PHP as a curiosity for programming. Later I learned some CSS &
JS. My first project was a simple Note making app and a Quiz app.
<br />
<br />
I continued learning more and more and started working on my side
projects. Recently is the moment where I finally understood what I want
to follow.
<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I am working as frontend engineer for Horizon.io, working in web3 space and
trying to finish my last year at high school.
